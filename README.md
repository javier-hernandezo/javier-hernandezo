### Hello everyone!

<!--
**uam-biometrics/uam-biometrics** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->

I am Javier Hernandez-Ortega, PhD in Computer Science and Electronic Engineering (Universidad Autonoma de Madrid). I am mainly focused on the research and development of state-of-the-art machine learning techniques (especially deep learning) and in applying them to tasks related to computer vision, biometrics (e.g., face recognition, face quality assessment, face antispoofing), and human computer interaction. Always looking for new challenges.

<!--and a place to grow personally and professionally.-->
