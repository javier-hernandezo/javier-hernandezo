### Hello everyone!

<!--
**uam-biometrics/uam-biometrics** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

I am Javier Hernandez-Ortega. I am currently pursuing a PhD in Computer Science and Electronic Engineering (est. ending date January 2022) and I received a M.Sc. Degree in Computer Science and Electronic Engineering in 2015 from Universidad Autonoma de Madrid. Now I am working at BiDA Lab â€“ Biometrics and Data Pattern Analytics Laboratory as Research Assistant (since 2016). I am mainly focused on the research and development of state-of-the-art machine learning techniques (especially deep learning) and in applying them to tasks related to computer vision, biometrics, and human computer interaction such as: estimating physiological signals from videos, face antispoofing, authentication, and quality assessment of images for face recognition. Always looking for new challenges.
